							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I like to ask questions — lots of them. I was certainly that little kid who would endlessly follow up every question with yet another “Why?”. While I may have annoyed my 6th grade science teacher and my parents on occasion, I think this infinite curiosity was a blessing because it led me to where and who I am today. </p>
						<p>The more I learn about the world, the more questions I have.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Why are vehicle-sharing services of all kinds suddenly becoming popular?</li>
							<li>Why do Millennials appear to value experiences more and material possessions less than their parents?</li>
							<li>Why are suicide rates in the United States increasing even though the standard of living is the highest it’s ever been?</li>
							<li>Why are cash payments more popular in Europe than in the US?</li>
							<li>Why are long form discussions and interviews via podcasts and YouTube shows becoming more popular?</li>
						</ul>
						<p>These are a few of the many questions I ponder on a regular basis. While I have my own theories to explain concurrent societal phenomena, it is very difficult to take a step back and examine them as if I am not a part of them. However, I still enjoy trying to make sense of them because understanding them allows me to better predict their evolution.</p>
						<p>I like to think of myself as someone with the brain of a scientist and the curiosity of a philosopher, but if I’m being completely honest, I’m probably just a nerd with too much time on my hands.</p>

						<h2>Innovation & Entrepreneurship</h2>
						<button class="accordion">My Story</button>
							<div class="panel">
  							<p>I am from Charlotte, NC and I decided to attend Duke University almost entirely for one reason: the people. From touring many schools and visiting some of them after acceptance to get a feel for the student life and campus atmosphere, Duke stood out immediately. Every campus had great buildings, organizations, and opportunities, but I chose Duke because every single student and prospective student I met was unique and passionate about an issue important to them.</p>
								<p>I am majoring in Computer Science with a certificate in Innovation & Entrepreneurship. I began my college career wanting to double major in physics and computer science because I have a deep interest in astronomy and astrophysics and was fascinated by the idea of computer simulations to better understand and predict astronomical phenomena. However, after much consideration, I decided to drop the physics major to pursue a more entrepreneurial route. I chose computer science because I’ve always had a natural interest and knack for it, and I believe it to be the major that will best equip me to solve problems in a new and more effective way than in the past. I chose the Innovation and Entrepreneurship certificate because I believe the program’s curriculum is the most relevant to the kind of work I expect to be doing after graduation.</p>
								<p>I chose to take I&E 253 Social Media Marketing because I know that many marketing teams feel undervalued and I wanted to understand the value that they bring to a company. Additionally, I think it is incredibly important to understand all aspects of a products development and sale if I want to be an effective product or company leader in the future.</p>
								<p>So far, my entrepreneurial experience includes the work I did with Praos Health over the summer of 2018. The main focus of my work there was to extract information from their database and convert it into useful metrics to demonstrate the value of the product. </p>

								<h3><strong>I&E 253 Social Media Marketing</strong></h3>
								<p>This goal of this course is to analyze the strategies employed by corporations, celebrities, and influencers to develop their online brands.</p>
								<h4>Reflection</h4>
								<p>I took this course as a part of my Innovation & Entrepreneurship pathway because I believe it is the one aspect of developing a business in which I knew the least. Additionally, the vast majority of social media users don’t think twice about the posts they see from their favorite brands, celebrities, or influencers. </p>
								<p>The worldwide expansion of social media and its current trajectory leads me to believe that marketing on social media will take on a key role in the development of any modern company. Furthermore, the sheer size of the audience provides an entirely new marketing medium unlike any other. Because I want to be a future product/company leader, I believe it is absolutely essential that I have an understanding of the role and strategies of marketing teams. In order to be most effective, a leader must understand every aspect of their product’s value from the customer’s perspective, so that they can efficiently focus efforts on improving the most valuable aspect of the product and understand how to communicate this value to the customer. </p>
								<p>I&E 253 demonstrated the value of a strong online marketing presence and the tactics one must use in order to maximize marketing resources to their full potential. I learned that there is no single answer to the question: “How can I better market my product or brand?” Every marketing team must first identify the image or message it would like to portray of its product or brand. Apple focuses on the development of blending its image of innovation and simplicity to convey the message that it creates the best products for everyone. On the other hand, Wendy’s focuses its efforts on capturing the juvenile culture of Twitter’s jokes and short jabs at others, creating the image that a massive corporation is just like your friends.</p>
								<p>Another useful thing I learned from this class is how different social media sites are valuable in different ways. For a company like GoPro, Instagram is the obvious best choice to market their product because it is in their product’s very nature to produce interesting visual content. Whereas a company like Budweiser might find more success on Facebook because of the success of short video advertisements on this medium.</p>
